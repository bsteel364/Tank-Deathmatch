# Tank Deathmatch
Tank Deathmatch is my attempt at an open-arena tank battle sim, made with Unreal Engine 4.  My goals are to make the game available for head-to-head local multiplayer, as well as a single-player mode that features AI opponents who continue to adapt to the player's tactics.  The game will feature very basic destructables such as trees that fall over when hit, and craters that form in the ground where an artillary shell has landed.  



# Inital Landscape Design

This serves only as the basic concept for the map, having only done landscaping and basic texturing.
